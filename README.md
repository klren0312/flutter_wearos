# Wearos App Test

A new Flutter Wear OS project.

---

## Getting Started ðŸš€

This project contains 3 flavors:

- development
- staging
- production

To run the desired flavor either use the launch configuration in VSCode/Android Studio or use the following commands:

```sh
# Development
$ flutter run --flavor development --target lib/main_development.dart

# Staging
$ flutter run --flavor staging --target lib/main_staging.dart

# Production
$ flutter run --flavor production --target lib/main_production.dart
```

_\*This template includes only the Android runner, as it is meant to run on Wear OS devices only._
